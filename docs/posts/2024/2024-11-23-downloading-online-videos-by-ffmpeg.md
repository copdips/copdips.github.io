# Downloading online videos by ffmpeg

Sometimes, we need to download online videos maybe a Teams recording. Here's a [tip from StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72653505/5095636) by using [ffmpeg](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/). Be sure to check the comments for solutions to errors like "*Error opening input: Invalid data found when processing input*.". Another solution is to use [kylon/Sharedown](https://github.com/kylon/Sharedown) which is much more faster.
