## Azure SDK Python Guidelines

- [https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python_implementation.html](https://azure.github.io/azure-sdk/python_implementation.html)

## Lint

- Update 2023-05-21: Replaced flake8, pylint, black and isort by [ruff](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff). When replacing pylint, should [add check by mypy](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/faq/#how-does-ruff-compare-to-pylint).
- Update 2023-11-07: Bandit could be replaced by ruff too with the support of flake-bandit.
- Update 2025-08-31: [Ty or Pyrefly](../2025/2025-02-01-python-type-hints.md#typing-tools) (both written in Rust) could be used for type checking.

!!! note
    The only thing ruff can't do at the moment is [type checking](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/faq/#how-does-ruff-compare-to-mypy-or-pyright-or-pyre).

### ruff

Fast, just blazing fast.

```bash
# lint
ruff check

# format
ruff format

# show ignored ruff alerts
ruff check --ignore-noqa --exit-zero
```

!!! note "try also `uv pip install`"
    For `pip install` users, try [uv pip install](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) from the same author of ruff. [uv cheat sheet here](../2025/2025-08-26-python-uv-cheat-sheet.md).

    A highly opinionated and subjective perspective, but finally, we have a real competitor (or even a replacement) of `pip install`. If you have a private PyPi index, all you need to setup is `export UV_DEFAULT_INDEX=$PIP_INDEX_URL`; otherwise, just add `uv` before `pip install` command.

### pylint

!!! warning
    Replaced by [ruff](#ruff).

As pylint has too many options, it's recommended to use the pylint config file:

```bash
# file ~/.pylintrc, can be generated by pylint --generate-rcfile

[MASTER]

[MESSAGES CONTROL]
disable=
    C0116, # Missing function or method docstring (missing-function-docstring)
    W1203, # Use lazy % formatting in logging functions (logging-fstring-interpolation)

[format]
max-line-length = 88

[MISCELLANEOUS]
# List of note tags to take in consideration, separated by a comma.
notes=FIXME

[VARIABLES]

# List of additional names supposed to be defined in builtins. Remember that
# you should avoid defining new builtins when possible.
additional-builtins=
    spark
```

But we can also ignore some warnings directly in the pylint command:

```bash
pylint . -j 0 --disable=C0116,W1203
```

To show all the inline ignored pylint alerts: `pylint --enable=suppressed-message`

#### Ignore Unused Argument given a Function Name Expression

Use [dummy variable](https://pylint.pycqa.org/en/latest/user_guide/configuration/all-options.html#dummy-variables-rgx) to ignore the Pylint warning on [unused-argument](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/issues/1057).

### flake8

!!! warning
    Replaced by [ruff](#ruff).

```bash
# ignore W503 because of black format. BTW, flake8 also has W504 which is in contrary to W503.
# ignore E501, line too long because we have the same check at Pylint side already.
flake8 . \
  --exclude=venv \
  --extend-ignore=E203,E501,W503, \
  --max-complexity=7 \
  --show-source \
  --statistics \
  --count \
  --jobs=auto

flake8 [a_file_path]
```

To show all the inline ignored flake8 alerts: `flake8 --disable-noqa || true`

There's a very nice flake8 plugin called [**flake8-cognitive-complexity**](https://github.com/Melevir/flake8-cognitive-complexity) which checks the [Cognitive Complexity](https://blog.sonarsource.com/cognitive-complexity-because-testability-understandability) in addition to the Cyclomatic Complexity provided by flake8 out of the box. We dont need to add extra parameter to use the Cognitive Complexity in flake8, it's set to `--max-cognitive-complexity=7` by default once the plugin is installed. By the way, Sonar sets the Cognitive Complexity threshold to 15 by default.

To fix `imported but not used` error in `__init__.py` file, could by [`__all__`](https://stackoverflow.com/a/31079085/5095636) attribute (the most elegant) or by [--per-file-ignores](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/user/options.html#cmdoption-flake8-per-file-ignores).

### bandit

!!! warning
    Replaced by [ruff](#ruff).

The bandit config file format is not well documented, I passed a lot of time to test the config.

```bash
$ cat .bandit
# https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit/issues/400
exclude_dirs:
  - "./venv/*"

# https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit/pull/633
assert_used:
  skips:
    - "*/*_test.py"
    - "*/test_*.py"
```

```bash
# without specifying -c ./bandit, it doesn't work
$ bandit . -r -c ./.bandit
```

### ossaudit

[ossaudit](https://github.com/illikainen/ossaudit) uses [Sonatype OSS Index](https://ossindex.sonatype.org/) to audit Python packages for known vulnerabilities.

It can check installed packages and/or packages specified in dependency files. The following formats are supported with [dparse](https://github.com/pyupio/dparse):

- PIP requirement files
- Pipfile
- Pipfile.lock
- tox.ini
- conda.yml

```bash
# check installed packages and packages listed in two requirements files
$ ossaudit --installed --file requirements.txt --file requirements-dev.txt
Found 0 vulnerabilities in 214 packages
```

Github has already provided, free of charge, the [vulnerable dependencies alert](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/managing-vulnerabilities-in-your-projects-dependencies/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies).

### mypy

!!! note
    While mypy is significantly less performant than [modern typing tools written in Rust](../2025/2025-02-01-python-type-hints.md#typing-tools), it remains the gold standard for type checking in Python. As of September 2025, all Rust-based typing tools are still in preview stage.

For projects using SQLAlchemy, consider installing the `sqlalchemy-stubs` plugin to handle SQLAlchemy's dynamic class generation. And also django-stubs, pandas-stubs, types-setuptools, types-requests etc.

Just some personal notes on mypy, though [this post](../2025/2025-02-01-python-type-hints.md) based on the official MyPy documentation.

[mypy config file](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config_file.html):

```ini
[mypy]
ignore_missing_imports = True # We recommend using this approach only as a last resort: it's equivalent to adding a # type: ignore to all unresolved imports in your codebase.
plugins = sqlmypy # sqlalchemy-stubs
exclude = (?x)(
    ^venv
    | ^build
  )
```

running mypy:

```bash
mypy .
mypy . --exclude [a regular expression that matches file path]
mypy . --exclude venv[//] # exclude venv folder under the root
```

!!! warning
    When using mypy, it would be better to use mypy against to [all files in the project](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/13916), but not some of them.

#### Auto discover missing stub files

```bash
# search available stubs, and ask for installation,
# that can be used to declared the stub packages into requirements files.
mypy --install-types  .

# for local quick test, we might not care about the requirements files.
mypy --install-types --non-interactive .
```

### pyright

!!! warning
    Replaced by [ty](#ty). More info about Python typing tools in this [post](../2025/2025-02-01-python-type-hints.md#typing-tools)

faster than mypy.

```bash
pyproject.toml:

```toml
[tool.pyright]
reportUnnecessaryTypeIgnoreComment = true
include = []
exclude = []
```

- running pyright locally:

    ```bash
    ## scan pathes specified in pyproject.toml include, exclude
    pyright

    ## scan current folder and subfolders in spite of pyproject.toml include, exclude
    pyright .
    ```

- running pyright in pre-commit:

    ```yaml title=".pre-commit-config.yaml"
    - repo: https://github.com/RobertCraigie/pyright-python
      rev: v1.1.388
      hooks:
        - id: pyright
    ```

- running pyright in Github Action:

    ```yaml title="github action"
    - name: Run lint
      run: |
        # in case pre-commit has set up a pyright hook, we should not use it in CI.
        SKIP=pyright pre-commit run --all-files

    - uses: jakebailey/pyright-action@v2
    ```

- running pyright in other CI Solutions:
  <https://github.com/microsoft/pyright/blob/main/docs/ci-integration.md>

### pylyzer

!! warning
    Replaced by [ty](#ty). The author is working for ty now. More info about Python typing tools in this [post](../2025/2025-02-01-python-type-hints.md#typing-tools).

A fast, feature-rich static code analyzer (type checker) & language server for Python written in Rust. A possible mypy, pyright replacement in the future, currently it's still in the [early stage](https://github.com/mtshiba/pylyzer/issues/59#issuecomment-1851284715).

pylyzer [converts Python ASTs to Erg ASTs](https://github.com/mtshiba/pylyzer#how-it-works) and passes them to Erg's type checker. It then displays the results with appropriate modifications.

```bash
# check single file
pylyzer single_python_file.py

# check entire package
pylyzer
```

### ty

Fast, feature-rich static code analyzer (type checker) & language server for Python written in Rust. It also has a competitor called [pyrefly](https://pyrefly.org/) from Meta. As of September 2025, both are in preview stage yet.

More info about Python typing tools in this [post](../2025/2025-02-01-python-type-hints.md#typing-tools)

### pyrefly

Like ty written in Rust maintained by Meta.

### ignore lint error in one line

!!! warning
    All linters could be replaced by [ruff](#ruff), only typing checkers like mypy and pyright are not supported by ruff.

|      linter      |                                   ignore in one line                                   |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ruff             | (2 spaces)# noqa: {errorIdentifier}                                                    |
| pylint           | (2 spaces)# pylint: disable={errorIdentifier}                                          |
| flake8           | (2 spaces)# noqa: {errorIdentifier}                                                    |
| bandit           | (2 spaces)# nosec                                                                      |
| pyright          | (2 spaces)# pyright: ignore [reportOptionalMemberAccess, reportGeneralTypeIssues]      |
| mypy             | (2 spaces)# type: ignore                                                               |
| ty               | (2 spaces)# ty: ignore[unresolved-attribute]                                           |
| multiple linters | (2 spaces)# type: ignore # noqa: {errorIdentifier} # pylint: disable={errorIdentifier} |

To ignore Pylint within a code block:

```python

## https://stackoverflow.com/a/48836605/5095636
import sys
sys.path.append("xx/xx")

## pylint: disable=wrong-import-position
from x import (  # noqa: E402
    a,
    b,
)
from y import c  # noqa: E402

## pylint: enable=wrong-import-position
```

## Format

### isort

!!! warning
    Replaced by [ruff](#ruff).

```bash
isort . --profile=black --virtual-env=venv --recursive --check-only
isort . --profile=black --virtual-env=venv --recursive
isort [a_file_path]
```

!!! warning
    Be very careful with isort, it's not uncompromising, especially for some codes that dynamically import some modules inside a function instead of from the beginning of a file. People use often this to avoid circular import problem. Always run the tests after the isort.

### black

!!! warning
    Replaced by [ruff](#ruff).

```bash
black . --check
black .
black [a_file_path]
```

Using black with other tools: [https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/using_black_with_other_tools.html](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/using_black_with_other_tools.html)

## Coverage

For Open Source, [Codecov](https://about.codecov.io/for/open-source/) and [SonarQube](https://www.sonarsource.com/plans-and-pricing/sonarcloud/) are both free, and have both Github Actions. SonarQube is also a powerful static linting tool.

### SonarQube

- CI based config
    <https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarcloud/advanced-setup/ci-based-analysis/sonarscanner-cli/>

    ```config title="sonar-project.properties"
    sonar.sources=src
    sonar.tests=tests
    sonar.python.version=3.11 3.12
    sonar.python.coverage.reportPaths=coverage.xml
    sonar.qualitygate.ignoreSmallChanges=false
    ```

- Automatic analysis
    Triggered on each push
    <https://docs.sonarsource.com/sonarcloud/advanced-setup/automatic-analysis>

## VSCode

Just my 2 cents, try the [errorlens](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=usernamehw.errorlens) extension in VSCode, it will lint all the warnings/errors on live when coding, it's really cool.

And don't forget to install the official [SonarLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=SonarSource.sonarlint-vscode) extension, it will give you extra lint. It eats a lot of memory with its java processes nevertheless.

## pyproject.toml

`pyproject.toml` is the new standard in Python introduced by [PEP 518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) (2016) for build system requirements, [PEP 621](https://peps.python.org/pep-0621/) (2020) for project metadata, and [PEP 660](https://peps.python.org/pep-0660/) (2021) for wheel based editable installs.

It's fun to know [why Python authority chose this name](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/#other-file-names), and very interesting to understand their POV of [different file formats](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/#other-file-formats) :smile:.

All the the major tools (setuptools, pip-tools, poetry) support this new standard, and the repo [awesome-pyproject](https://github.com/carlosperate/awesome-pyproject/) maintains a list of Python tools which are compatible to `pyproject.toml`.

!!! warning

    We cannot officially [declare flake8 config in pyproject.toml](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8/issues/234).

## Git pre-commit

[https://pre-commit.com/](https://pre-commit.com/)

> "Git hook scripts are useful for identifying simple issues before submission to code review. We run our hooks on every commit to automatically point out issues in code such as missing semicolons, trailing whitespace, and debug statements. By pointing these issues out before code review, this allows a code reviewer to focus on the architecture of a change while not wasting time with trivial style nitpicks."

```bash
pip install pre-commit

# pre-commit install by default installs pre-commit hook only:
pre-commit install

# add --hook-type to add other git hook types:
pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push


## install the script along with the hook environments in one command

## https://pre-commit.com/index.html#pre-commit-install-hooks
pre-commit install --install-hooks

## Auto-update pre-commit config to the latest repos' versions.
pre-commit autoupdate

## Clean out cached pre-commit files.
pre-commit clean

## Clean unused cached repos.
pre-commit gc

## Run single check
pre-commit run black

## continuous integration

## https://pre-commit.com/index.html#usage-in-continuous-integration
pre-commit run --all-files

# run on all modified and untracked files
# -m / --modified: tracked files with unstaged changes
# -o / --others: untracked files
# --exclude-standard: respects .gitignore
pre-commit run --files $(git ls-files -m -o --exclude-standard)

## check only files which have changed
pre-commit run --from-ref origin/HEAD --to-ref HEAD

## Azure pipeline example with cache

pre-commit init-templatedir ~/.git-template
```

### Online examples

[pylint github pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/PyCQA/pylint/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml)

### Create a file named `.pre-commit-config.yaml` to the root of your project

!!! note

    Although each lint has its own config to exclude some files from checking, pre-commit also has the key [exclude](https://pre-commit.com/#hooks-exclude) with list value or [regex](https://pre-commit.com/#regular-expressions) to exclude file from sending to linter.

!!! note

    `language: system` means using the executables from the same environment of current Python interpreter.

!!! warning

    When using mypy in pre-commit, it would be better run `pre-commit run --all-files`, mypy [doesn't work well with only diff files](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/13916) sent by `pre-commit run --from-ref origin/${pullrequest_target_branch_name} --to-ref HEAD`.

Hereunder an example of `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in my [fastapi-demo](https://github.com/copdips/fastapi-demo/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml) repo.

```yaml title=".pre-commit-config.yaml"

### Install the git hook scripts

```bash
# for gitlint, we install the commit-msg hook type:
# https://jorisroovers.com/gitlint/latest/commit_hooks/#pre-commit
$ pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/commit-msg

$ pre-commit install
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-commit

$ pre-commit install --hook-type post-merge
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/post-merge

$ pre-commit install --hook-type pre-merge-commit
pre-commit installed at .git/hooks/pre-merge-commit
```

!!! note

    You could also run `pre-commit install --hook-type pre-push` to register pre-push hooks.

### Run against all the files

> "it's usually a good idea to run the hooks against all of the files when adding new hooks (usually pre-commit will only run on the changed files during git hooks)"

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
# or
pre-commit run -a
```

### Run for changed files only in CI

Please check also this [official doc](https://pre-commit.com/#usage-in-continuous-integration).

```bash
git fetch origin
pre-commit run --from-ref origin/${pullrequest_target_branch_name} --to-ref HEAD
```

!!! warning

    When using mypy, it would be better to use mypy against to [all files in the project](https://github.com/python/mypy/issues/13916), but not the changed one only.

### Git commit

Each time we use git commit to stage some files, these files will be sent to pre-commit to be checked against to the hooks defined in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.

### Temporarily disabling hooks

The [official doc](https://pre-commit.com/#temporarily-disabling-hooks) gives the example how to disable explicitly hooks by hooks' ids: `SKIP=flake8 git commit -m "foo"`, but if you want to disable completely all the hooks, an easy way might be found [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/7230886) by using `git commit --no-verify` or its shortcut `git commit -n`. If you use [pre-commit during push](https://pre-commit.com/#pre-commit-during-push), you can disable pre-commit during push by `git push --no-verify` or `git push -n`.
